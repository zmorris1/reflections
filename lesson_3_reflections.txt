**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating with another person and you both are making changes to the code base.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Incase others are working on the same code base and you haven't had a chance to review their changes yet and don't necessarily want them on your local computer yet.
