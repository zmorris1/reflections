**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating with another person and you both are making changes to the code base.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Incase others are working on the same code base and you haven't had a chance to review their changes yet and don't necessarily want them on your local computer yet.

**Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone is when you copy a repository from Git onto your local computer.  A fork is when you copy a respository from Git onto you GitHub account.  A fork is the same as a clone, but all on Git's machines.  A branch is when you start making changes to a repository.

**What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can run a diff to see what changes have been made by others to the remote and choose whether or not to merge them to your local master branch.  So you always have the option of working on your own branch, or an up-to-date branch with the commits of others you're collaborating with.
