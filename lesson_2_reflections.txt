**What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You need to create your first commit.

**How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is where the repository lives.  The staging area is somewhat of a test zone, where you can view what you're about to commit to the repository before you commit it.
